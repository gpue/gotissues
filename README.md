gotissues
=========

A tiny issue tracker based on the Spring framework. It supports the work organization of groups of people and comes with some special features that makes gotissues unique:

* web-based, responsive user interface
* tree-structured issues (you can have sub-issues)
* human-centered issue content (not code-centered)
* JavaScript processes that lead people through repeating tasks and document what has to be done
* all functionality can be accesses through a REST API
* passwort encryption
* gamification: contributing to issues gives you different amounts of points so that people may compete (be careful with your organisation's policy!)
